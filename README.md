Awesome Agent Cortex connects the layers that ordinary framework lists leave apart: agent runtimes, coding tools, MCP, evaluation, memory, knowledge graphs, on-chain identity, payments, security, and observability. Use it to find one component or to understand how the pieces fit into a complete agent system.
